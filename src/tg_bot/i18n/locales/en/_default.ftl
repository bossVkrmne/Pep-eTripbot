    Hi 👋🏻
    Here you can earn money just by subscribing to channels and inviting friends 💰👥

    <b>How it works?</b>
    By inviting friends, subscribing to our partners and making daily check-ins, you will receive points.
    Points are the main and only indicator of your activity and contribution to the community 🫂
    The best referrers will receive rewards to the wallet (/wallet). Random active participants will also receive rewards.

    <b>About the economy:</b>
    <b>1.</b> Each subscription to channels in the "Current quests" tab will bring you {
        $subscription ->
            [one] { $subscription } point
            *[other] { $subscription } points
        } one time.
    <b>2.</b> Each subscription to our channels or the channels of our partners will give you {
         $checkin ->
            [one] { $checkin } point
            *[other] { $checkin } points
         } more per check-in.
    <b>3.</b> For inviting a referral you will receive {
        $invitation ->
            [one] { $invitation } point
            *[other] { $invitation } points
         } one time.
    <b>4.</b> For each check-in and subscription of your referral, you will receive a { $referrer_part }% of his reward.

    <b>Why are there so few points for a referral?</b>
    We believe and want our community to grow with active and interested users 🔍
    Therefore, invite active users and receive part of the reward from their efforts. But also, do not forget about your own efforts to stay in the top 🏆
    We also do not want to devalue the efforts of those people who do not have the opportunity to invite many friends, but are ready to show activeness and interest in our business 🚀
